Level Goal: 

The password for the next level is stored in a file called "spaces in the filename" located in the home directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similar to the previous challenge where cat will not be able to output filenames with spaces. You can use the ./"file spaces"
Using the "" will make it so the cat understand that it is one string instead of multiple.

Command used:
  ls
  cat ./"spaces in the filename"
